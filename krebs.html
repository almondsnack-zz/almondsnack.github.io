    <h1>KREBS FOR AMERICA</h1>
      <p class="mainspan">He's the man we want. Krebs is the man we need.</p>
    <h2>About the man</h2>
      <p class="span">“Who in the world is Brian Krebs, what does he do, and why is he a candidate?” –The unknown voter.</p>
      <p>Brian Krebs, an ex-employee of The Washington Post, is running for student council treasurer of Edison High School. Not only is he the most experienced candidate on the block, but he can get things done.</p>
      <p>Brian Krebs is a security journalist and reporter of the investigative variety, born here in the United States – and since ‘05, has been authoring some of the leading articles on computer security. Before working in the field of cybersecurity; he was an editorial aide for the department of editing, and desk of finance at [The Washington Post].</p>
      <p>Now, he is a man with immesurable experience in cybersecurity and criminal investigation; and, by this campaign, has been deemed as ideal for the effective governance of Edison High School.</p>
    <h3>For student council treasurer…</h3>
      <p>The lifetime experience of working in journalism, coupled with working in the financial sector for a significant period of time, affirms the concept that Brian Krebs is the most suitable candidate for EHS’ student council ‘treasurer’ position.<p>
      <p class="span">“I have worked with (Brian) Krebs, and his overall knowledge of security – along with finance – has been proven invaluable by his work.” -Richard.</p>
    <h2>Candidate’s background</h2>
      <p>The candidacy of Brian Krebs has historically stood for empowering privacy, and the alleviation of poorly-secured services; both across local and federal government. He’s been active in the campaign-space for a significant period of time.</p>
      <p>Krebs for America was founded just last year, to help provide resources (and information) to the supporters of Brian Krebs; and secondly, to spread information regarding treasurer Krebs.</p>
    <h3>Late ‘16</h3>
      <p>The campaign to support Brian Krebs and then-candidate Chairman Reyolds was initiated; and textual information to support the campaign, along with his co-runner, was planned and ‘sponsored’ by Krebs for America.</p>
      <p>A logical backing from esoForum ensued, which now provides the services under the name ‘Krebs for America’; and to this day, the esoForum service fully backs Brian Krebs for the student council.<p>
    <h3>Early ‘17</h3>
      <p>Krebs’ campaign expanded from a spot in the numerous candidates, to an element of the student’s core values; with Brian Krebs-related content soaring among the creative spaces of Edison.<p>
      <p>Brian Krebs was, and remains, the sole candidate to receive a backing from two non-profit organisations; and the school’s principal (Clay Vinyard).</p>
    <h3>Currently</h3>
      <p>As of now, the Krebs project is at the highest point of support it’s ever been; and currently, we’re working to continue embellishing the prospects of a Krebs-lead treasury.</p>
